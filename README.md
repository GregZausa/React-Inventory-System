Inventory System MVP

This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of a fully-featured Inventory Management System built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

Note: This MVP currently uses localStorage for data storage. The full version will integrate a backend database for persistent storage and advanced functionality.

Features

Add, Edit, Delete Items – Manage inventory items quickly.

LocalStorage Data Storage – Temporarily stores data on the browser.

React Frontend – Interactive and responsive user interface.

Hooks Usage – Utilizes React hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and custom hooks for efficient state management and logic reuse.

MERN Ready – Structured to integrate a Node.js backend and MongoDB for full-stack functionality later.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Backend (Future Version): Node.js, Express.js

Database (Future Version): MongoDB
